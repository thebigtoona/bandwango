# Mobile App Prototype

Here is the working prototype.  It uses vanilla js, html5, and compiled css so all of my css work was actually done in
the `scss` folder that is outside of `dist` in the root of the project. I did use CDNs for font awesome
and google fonts as well.   

## Instructions

_note: the package.json file is just for dev dependencies so I could use SCSS. There's nothing to actually install_

1. pull down the source code navigate to the `dist` folder and view the `index.html` file in your browser

2. the content is responsive set to not stretch past tablet size. the content should align properly for mobile and if you look at the content in browser tools like chrome dev tools you should be able to resize the window and view the content on mobile emulated screen sizes.
